Program stored on Arduino controlling the LED ring.

Rough draft
Load rq and then execute
Load
1. client writes the bit array file to a set directory, and records the signal interval for that file
2. client loads bit array from text file to Arduino sketch array and sets signal interval

Execute
1. adruino executes the program for the pattern and signal interval
2. polling in loop for first interrupt from hall sensor
3. After interrupt it will execute the pattern
4. the following hall sensor interrupts reset the pattern to the beginning.
